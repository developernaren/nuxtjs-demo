## NuxtJs Demo

### What we are building

I created this repo as part of presentation for Dubai Js Meetup 03.  
In this repo, I am demonstrating the basics of a NuxtJs App. I am creating a simple app that lists buildings but to see the details of the buildings you need to login into the app.  

This is a test repo I have created for reference for the live demo I will be doing.
